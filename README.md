# Dojo Excercise
![Minitest Status](https://github.com/chriscarlisle/dojo-slowly-disemvowel-ruby/actions/workflows/minitests.yml/badge.svg)

## Task
For any given word, return a list of strings where one vowel has been removed at a time.

```
Minitest => Mnitest, Mntest, Mntst
```

#### Notes
The task did not specify how to deal with an input containing no vowels. I chose to return it.

```
Mntst => Mntst
```
